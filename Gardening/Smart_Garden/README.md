# Smart Garden
The Smart Garden project is the all-in-one solution for controlling the garden based on an ESP32. 

With the Smart Garden board you can read up to 4 different wired sensors or other Bluetooth based devices (such as the Xiaomi Mi Flora) and activate the water irrigators (electrovalves or water pumps) according to your own automations and routines!
